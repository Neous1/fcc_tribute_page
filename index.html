    <h1>A Son Of Adam is Born</h1>
    <h1>Early Years </h1>
    <p>Coltrane was born in his parents' apartment at 200 Hamlet Avenue, Hamlet, North Carolina on September 23, 1926.[3] His father was John R. Coltrane and his mother was Alice Blair. He grew up in High Point, North Carolina, attending William Penn High School (now Penn-Griffin School for the Arts).</p>

    <h1>The Gift Of A Lifetime</h1>
    <p>his mother bought him his first saxophone, an alto</p>

    <h1>In the Navy</h1>
    <p>Coltrane enlisted in the Navy on August 6, 1945, the day the first U.S. atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.Coltrane became one of the few Navy men to serve as a musician without having been granted musicians rating when he joined the Melody Masters, the base swing band. As the Melody Masters was an all-white band, however, Coltrane was treated merely as a guest performer to avoid alerting superior officers of his participation in the band. His first recordings, an informal session in Hawaii with Navy musicians, occurred on July 13, 1946.[12] Coltrane played alto saxophone on a selection of jazz standards and bebop tunes.</p>
